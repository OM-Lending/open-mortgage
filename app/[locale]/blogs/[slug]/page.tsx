        <h2>Why Your Choice of Broker Matters</h2>
        <p>A good mortgage broker does more than compare interest rates. The right broker will understand your goals, explain complex products in plain language, and advocate for you with lenders from application through to settlement.</p>

        <h3>1. Check Experience and Licensing</h3>
        <p>Ask how long they have been in the industry, what qualifications they hold, and which regulators or industry bodies they are registered with. An experienced, properly licensed broker is more likely to anticipate hurdles before they arise.</p>

        <h3>2. Understand Their Lender Panel</h3>
        <p>No broker works with every lender, but they should have access to a broad panel that includes major banks and specialist lenders. Ask which lenders they regularly use and why, and whether they can explain the differences between them for your situation.</p>

        <h3>3. Ask How They Are Paid</h3>
        <p>Most brokers are paid by the lender, not by you directly, but it is important to understand whether there are any additional fees. A transparent broker will clearly outline any upfront or ongoing costs and provide this information in writing.</p>

        <h3>4. Look for Clear Communication</h3>
        <p>You should feel comfortable asking questions at every stage. Choose a broker who responds promptly, explains options in simple terms, and sets realistic expectations about timing, documentation, and possible outcomes.</p>

        <h3>5. Assess Their Support After Settlement</h3>
        <p>The relationship should not end when your loan settles. A strong broker will review your loan regularly, help you understand rate changes, and discuss refinancing opportunities when it makes sense.</p>

        <p>By taking the time to ask these questions and compare options, you can partner with a broker who understands your needs and supports your long-term property and financial goals.</p>

        <h2>How Mortgage Rates Work</h2>
        <p>Mortgage rates are the interest rates charged on home loans. They can vary significantly based on several factors including your credit score, loan amount, loan term, and market conditions.</p>
        
        <h3>Factors Affecting Mortgage Rates</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Credit Score:</strong> Higher credit scores typically result in lower interest rates.</li>
          <li><strong>Loan Amount:</strong> Larger loans may have different rate structures.</li>
          <li><strong>Loan Term:</strong> Shorter terms often have lower rates but higher monthly payments.</li>
          <li><strong>Market Conditions:</strong> Economic factors influence overall rate trends.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Fixed vs Variable Rates</h3>
        <p>Fixed rates remain constant throughout the loan term, providing stability and predictability. Variable rates can fluctuate with market conditions, potentially offering lower initial rates but with less certainty.</p>
        
        <p>Understanding these factors can help you make informed decisions when choosing a mortgage product that suits your financial situation.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Assess Your Financial Situation</h3>
        <p>Before you start looking at properties, it's important to understand your financial position. Calculate your savings, assess your income stability, and review your credit score.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Save for a Deposit</h3>
        <p>Most lenders require a deposit of at least 10-20% of the property value. Start saving early and consider government assistance programs for first home buyers.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 3: Get Pre-Approval</h3>
        <p>Obtaining pre-approval gives you a clear idea of your borrowing capacity and shows sellers you're a serious buyer.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 4: Find Your Property</h3>
        <p>Work with real estate agents and attend open houses. Consider location, property condition, and future growth potential.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 5: Finalize Your Loan</h3>

        <h3>Save for a Larger Deposit</h3>
        <p>A larger deposit reduces the lender's risk and can improve your approval chances. It may also help you secure better interest rates.</p>
        
        <h3>Provide Complete Documentation</h3>
        <p>Ensure all required documents are accurate and up-to-date. Incomplete applications can delay or derail the approval process.</p>

        <h2>Thinking of Upgrading Your Car? Everything You Need to Know!</h2>
        <p>
          Looking to upgrade your car but don’t want to drain your savings with a lump-sum payment?
          Many buyers are now opting for <strong>car loans (auto loans)</strong> to finance their vehicle purchases.
          A car loan allows you to buy a new or used car while repaying the loan over a fixed term
          (typically between <strong>1 to 7 years</strong>), along with interest.
        </p>

        <p>
          Choosing the <strong>right car loan</strong> can save you thousands of dollars in interest and fees.
          That’s why we often recommend a <strong>Business Car Loan</strong> for eligible customers.
          In this guide, we’ll break down the key factors to consider and the
          <strong>advantages of a business car loan</strong>.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h3>What to Consider When Applying for a Business Car Loan?</h3>

        <p>
          To secure a <strong>competitive business car loan</strong>, lenders consider several factors,
          including your business details, financial history and the vehicle itself.
        </p>

        <h4>Business &amp; Applicant Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Australian Business Number (ABN)</strong> – How long has your ABN been registered?
            Have you registered for <strong>Goods and Services Tax (GST)</strong>, and for how long?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Residency Status</strong> – Are you an Australian citizen or permanent resident (PR)?
            If not, do other company shareholders meet this requirement and agree to be co-applicants?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Property Ownership</strong> – Are you a homeowner? These factors can impact interest rates;
            for example, a longer ABN/GST registration history may help secure lower rates.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Vehicle Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The car must be registered under a <strong>business name or ABN</strong>.</li>
          <li>Is the car being purchased from a <strong>dealer</strong> or a <strong>private seller</strong>?</li>
          <li>Is it a <strong>new</strong> or <strong>used</strong> car?</li>
          <li>
            Vehicle details: <strong>make, model, year of manufacture, purchase year and loan application year</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Loan amount, loan term and balloon payment options</strong> – A balloon payment is a lump sum
            paid at the end of the loan term. It reduces monthly repayments in exchange for a larger final payment.
            (Interest rates may vary; for example, dealer purchases and new cars often come with lower rates.)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h3>Key Benefits of a Business Car Loan</h3>

        <h4>1. No Income Proof Required</h4>
        <p>
          Unlike many personal car loans, most <strong>business car loans</strong> do not always require the same level
          of income documentation, which can make the application process quicker and easier for eligible applicants.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Improve Cash Flow &amp; Business Growth</h4>
        <p>A business car loan allows you to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Preserve cash flow</strong> – Keep funds available for other essential business expenses.</li>
          <li><strong>Expand your business</strong> – Invest in important assets without a large upfront cost.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Access the vehicle immediately</strong> – Start using the car for work while repaying it
            in manageable instalments.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Tax Benefits</h4>
        <p>
          One of the biggest <strong>advantages</strong> of a business car loan is the potential
          <strong>tax deductions</strong> you may be eligible for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Loan interest payments</strong> may be tax-deductible.</li>
          <li><strong>Vehicle depreciation</strong> can be claimed as an expense.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Operating costs</strong> (fuel, maintenance, insurance, etc.) may also be deductible,
            reducing overall expenses.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>4. GST Deductions</h4>
        <p>
          Business car loans can also allow you to claim <strong>GST credits</strong> on the purchase price,
          provided the vehicle is used for business purposes and your company is <strong>GST-registered</strong>.
          The amount you can claim depends on the purchase price of the vehicle and your individual circumstances.

      title: "Comparison Rate vs. Standard Variable Rate (SVR)",
      date: "2025-02-11",
      content: `
        <h2>Comparison Rate vs. Standard Variable Rate (SVR): Do You Really Understand the Difference?</h2>
        <p>
        When searching for a home loan, understanding the different types of interest rates offered by lenders is crucial. 
        While fixed and variable interest rates are commonly known, two rare but essential concepts are the 
        <strong>Comparison Rate</strong> and the <strong>Standard Variable Rate (SVR)</strong>. 
        Many borrowers find these terms confusing, but knowing what they mean can help you choose the best mortgage option.
        </p>

        <h3>What Is a Comparison Rate?</h3>

        <p>
        A <strong>Comparison Rate</strong> reflects the true cost of a loan by incorporating both the interest rate and certain associated fees. 
        Its primary purpose is to help borrowers accurately compare loan products offered by different financial institutions and mortgage providers.
        </p>

        <p>
        Comparison rates are calculated using a formula regulated by the 
        <strong>Consumer Credit Code</strong>, ensuring that all Australian financial institutions use the same calculation method. 
        Typically, this rate is based on a <strong>$150,000 loan over a 25-year term</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>However, it’s important to note that the comparison rate <strong>does not include</strong>:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Government fees, such as stamp duty or mortgage registration fees.</li>
          <li>Fees associated with optional loan features, like early repayment or redraw facilities.</li>
          <li>Costs that haven’t been determined at the time of calculation.</li>
          <li>Savings from benefits such as waived fees or interest offset accounts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Also, different loan terms, fees, and amounts may result in varying comparison rates. 
        For instance, for <strong>interest-only variable loans</strong>, the comparison rate is based on a 5-year interest-only period, while for 
        <strong>fixed interest-only loans</strong>, it is calculated based on the length of the fixed term. 
        Since interest-only payments do not reduce the principal loan amount, borrowers may end up paying more interest over time.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> A comparison rate provides a benchmark for understanding a loan’s actual cost. 
        However, because it is based on a <strong>standardized loan amount</strong>, it may not fully reflect your specific borrowing situation, especially if your loan is significantly higher than <strong>$150,000</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>What Is the Standard Variable Rate (SVR)?</h3>

        <p>
        The <strong>Standard Variable Rate (SVR)</strong> is the base interest rate applied to a lender’s standard home loan. 
        It serves as the <strong>benchmark rate</strong> for pricing other variable-rate mortgage products.
        </p>

        <p>
        SVR loans typically offer features such as <strong>offset accounts</strong> and <strong>redraw facilities</strong>, 
        but they often come with a higher interest rate than basic variable loan products.
        </p>

        <p>Each lender sets its own SVR, and these rates fluctuate based on factors like:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)</strong> cash rate changes.</li>
          <li>Market conditions and lender-specific policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        For example, if the RBA increases the cash rate by <strong>0.25%</strong>, major banks and lenders generally adjust their SVRs accordingly. 
        However, changes in SVRs are <strong>not uniform across all lenders</strong>, meaning one bank may raise or lower its rate while others do not.
        </p>

        <h3>How Does the SVR Impact Your Final Interest Rate?</h3>

        <p>
        When choosing a home loan, lenders usually offer <strong>discounted rates</strong> based on the SVR. 
        The final interest rate you receive depends on factors such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Loan purpose</strong> (e.g., owner-occupied or investment property).</li>
          <li><strong>Loan amount</strong> (higher amounts may qualify for bigger discounts).</li>
          <li><strong>Property market value.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR)</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Credit score</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        For example, some lenders offer a <strong>basic variable rate</strong> loan with fewer features, which may be lower than an SVR-based loan. 
        However, in a rising interest rate environment, discounted SVR loans can sometimes provide better savings.
        </p>

        <h3>Choosing the Right Home Loan for You</h3>

        <p>
        To determine the best home loan for your needs, it’s essential to consider more than just the advertised rate. 
        Features, fees, and potential rate changes can significantly impact your repayment costs over time.

      title: "Why Are More People Becoming Mortgage Prisoners?",
      date: "2025-02-17",
      content: `
        <p>Refinancing is a common practice in home loans. Many people choose to refinance periodically, as it allows them to secure better interest rates (new customers often receive special rate discounts) and get a substantial cashback rebate, typically around $4,000. However, recently, many borrowers are finding it increasingly difficult to refinance their existing loans, especially those with higher loan amounts. This phenomenon has been coined as "Mortgage Prisoners."</p>

        <h2>What Are Mortgage Prisoners?</h2>

        <p>With the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) continuously raising interest rates in recent months, market interest rates are climbing. At the same time, property values are under pressure and declining, causing many Australian homeowners to become “mortgage prisoners.” In essence, a mortgage prisoner is someone whose loan is effectively stuck with the same bank, unable to refinance to a better deal.</p>

        <p>When refinancing, regardless of whether it's a dollar-for-dollar transfer or increasing the loan amount, the basic requirement is to pass the serviceability calculator – a loan assessment tool used by banks to determine whether your current financial situation supports the loan. The ongoing interest rate hikes and declining property values have significantly impacted borrowers' ability to meet these criteria, trapping them with their current lender.</p>

        <h2>Causes of Mortgage Prisoners</h2>

        <p>From a macroeconomic perspective, two main factors contribute to the rise of mortgage prisoners: higher assessment rates and increasing Loan-to-Value Ratios (LVR).</p>

        <h3>1. Assessment Rate</h3>

        <p>As the Reserve Bank of Australia continues to increase the cash rate, banks are forced to pass on the pressure to borrowers. The assessment rate, which is used by lenders to evaluate your loan application, has been steadily rising. The higher the assessment rate, the less you can borrow under the same financial conditions.</p>

        <p>For instance, when interest rates were at 2%, borrowers could easily secure a loan of $800,000. However, when interest rates rise to 5%, the same borrower might only qualify for a $600,000 loan, even if their income remains unchanged. This demonstrates how interest rate hikes significantly reduce borrowing capacity.</p>

        <h3>2. Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR)</h3>

        <p>Interest rates and property values typically move in opposite directions. During an interest rate hike cycle, property values are under pressure, causing them to fall. As property prices decrease, the LVR (Loan-to-Value Ratio) increases, particularly if borrowers have made little progress in repaying their loans.</p>

        <p>For example, if you have an $800,000 loan on a property valued at $1 million, your LVR is 80%. But if your property’s value drops to $900,000, your LVR rises to 88%, and you’ll need to pay for Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI). A higher LVR also corresponds to higher interest rates, reducing your borrowing capacity.</p>

        <p>Under the combined pressure of these two factors, many borrowers cannot pass the bank’s loan test, even though their financial situation may be the same, or even better, than before. As a result, they remain “trapped” with their current lender.</p>

      title: "Bridging Loans: Should You Buy or Sell First When Moving Homes?",
      date: "2025-02-24",
      content: `
        <h2>Bridging Loans: Should You Buy or Sell First When Moving Homes?</h2>

        <p>Many homeowners face a common dilemma when upgrading to a new property: should you sell your current home first or buy a new one first? What happens to your mortgage in the transition? If you’ve explored your options, you’ve likely come across <strong>bridging loans</strong>—a financial solution designed to help you secure your next home while selling your existing one.</p>

        <h3>What Is a Bridging Loan?</h3>

        <p>A <strong>bridging loan</strong> is a short-term financing option that helps homeowners purchase a new property before selling their current one. Most people sell their home first and use the proceeds to buy their next property. However, buying first may be a more suitable option in some cases.</p>

        <p>If you’ve found your dream home but haven’t sold your current property yet, a <strong>bridging loan</strong> covers the financial gap between the two transactions. This temporary loan acts as a “bridge,” allowing you to buy now and repay the loan once your existing home is sold.</p>

        <h3>Key Considerations for Bridging Loans</h3>

        <p>Before applying for a bridging loan, consider the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>✓ <strong>Dual Mortgage Payments:</strong> You’ll need to manage both your current mortgage and the bridging loan simultaneously.</li>
          <li>✓ <strong>Loan Eligibility:</strong> Lenders require proof that you can afford the interest payments during the transition.</li>
          <li>✓ <strong>Repayment Period:</strong> Bridging loans typically have a <strong>12-month repayment timeframe</strong>, meaning you must sell your property within this period to avoid financial strain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When Is the Best Time to Sell Your Home?</h3>

        <p>Timing your property sale strategically can impact your financial outcome. Here are key factors to consider:</p>

        <h4>Seasonal Market Trends</h4>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spring:</strong> The busiest season for real estate, offering the highest number of listings and active buyers.</li>
          <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Fewer homes are on the market, meaning less competition and increased visibility for your property.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Market Conditions</h4>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Seller’s Market:</strong> High demand and low supply favour sellers, allowing for faster sales at higher prices.</li>
          <li><strong>Buyer’s Market:</strong> More homes are available than buyers, which can lead to longer selling times and price negotiations.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Monitoring <strong>local real estate trends, weekly sales data, and interest rate changes</strong> can help you determine the best time to list your home.</p>

        <h3>Should You Sell First or Buy First? Do You Need a Bridging Loan?</h3>

        <h4>Option 1: Sell First, Then Buy</h4>

        <p>✔ <strong>Pros:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>You’ll know exactly how much you can afford for your next home.</li>
          <li>No pressure to rush your purchase—you can wait for the right deal.</li>
          <li>Avoid the costs of a bridging loan and paying interest on two loans.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>✘ <strong>Cons:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your ideal home may not be available when you’re ready to buy.</li>
          <li>You might need to rent short-term, leading to extra moving and rental costs.</li>
          <li>Rising property prices after selling could increase the cost of your next home.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Option 2: Buy First, Then Sell</h4>

        <p>✔ <strong>Pros:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>No need for temporary housing or multiple moves.</li>
          <li>More flexibility to find the perfect home without time pressure.</li>
          <li>If the market is rising, you might sell at a higher price later.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>✘ <strong>Cons:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Requires a <strong>bridging loan</strong>, which comes with higher interest rates.</li>
          <li>Managing two mortgages at once can be financially stressful.</li>
          <li>If your old home takes longer to sell, repaying the loan within 12 months could be challenging.</li>
          <li>Conditional offers may need to be higher to persuade sellers to wait.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Reduce the Risks of Buying First</h3>

        <p>If you choose to buy before selling, here are some strategies to ease the transition:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>✓ <strong>Negotiate a Longer Settlement:</strong> Extend your selling timeline to secure your next home.</li>
          <li>✓ <strong>Request a Rent-Back Option:</strong> Ask the buyer if you can rent your old home for a short period.</li>
          <li>✓ <strong>Stay with Friends or Family:</strong> Save on rental costs and use storage facilities if needed.</li>
          <li>✓ <strong>Short-Term Rental:</strong> Renting a furnished home can reduce moving hassles and expenses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Is a Bridging Loan Right for You?</h3>

        <p>Every financial situation is unique. Before committing to a <strong>bridging loan</strong>, consult a mortgage broker to evaluate your options. They can help you find the best financing solution based on your income, loan eligibility, and market conditions.</p>

        <p>By understanding the pros and cons of selling first vs. buying first, you can make an informed decision that aligns with your financial goals and lifestyle needs.</p>

      title: "Can Parents on Parental Leave Still Apply for a Home Loan?",
      date: "2025-02-26",
      content: `
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
        A couple, already homeowners with an existing mortgage, faced financial strain due to rising interest rates. 
        The wife, pregnant in April last year, commenced parental leave in November and planned to return to work in early July. 
        With their fixed-rate mortgage set to expire simultaneously, they needed to refinance to secure a lower interest rate and reduce their monthly repayments.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Lack of Recent Payslips:</strong> 
            Since the wife had been on parental leave for several months, she did not have recent income statements to support their refinancing application.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Single-Income Constraint:</strong> 
            Since only the husband’s income was available during this period, the couple’s financial profile appeared weaker under the bank’s assessment criteria.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Loan Approval Concerns:</strong> 
            Most lenders require proof of stable income, and the temporary loss of the wife’s salary raised concerns about their repayment capacity.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Key Considerations for Loan Approval</h2>

        <p>
        To successfully refinance, the couple needed to demonstrate to the bank that they had sufficient financial resources to meet their mortgage obligations. 
        The bank was willing to consider the wife’s income under specific conditions:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Proof of Savings:</strong> 
            The wife needed to show that she had enough savings or assets to cover living expenses during her parental leave.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Return to Work Confirmation:</strong> 
            A formal letter from her employer confirming her job status and salary upon returning to work.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What a Return to Work Letter Should Include</h2>

        <p>A valid <strong>Return to Work Letter</strong> must contain the following details:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Confirmed return-to-work date</li>
          <li>Employment conditions (full-time/part-time status, working hours, hourly wage, etc.)</li>
          <li>Employee’s full name (matching the loan applicant)</li>
          <li>Salary details upon return</li>
          <li>Employer’s official letterhead</li>
          <li>Employer’s ABN (Australian Business Number)</li>
          <li>Employer’s signature and date</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Solution & Outcome</h2>

        <p>We guided the couple through the refinancing process by ensuring they met all bank requirements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The wife provided a bank statement proving she had sufficient savings for her leave period.
          </li>
          <li>
            She obtained a properly structured <strong>Return to Work Letter</strong> from her employer.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        With these documents, we submitted their refinancing application. 
        As a result, the couple successfully secured one of the lowest available home loan interest rates at the time. 
        Additionally, they received a <strong>$4,000 refinance cashback</strong>, significantly easing their financial burden and reducing their monthly repayments.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Takeaways for Parents on Parental Leave Seeking a Home Loan</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            ✓ <strong>Check lender policies</strong> – Some banks may be more flexible with parental leave cases than others.
          </li>
          <li>
            ✓ <strong>Prepare savings proof</strong> – Demonstrate financial stability with bank statements showing sufficient funds.

      date: "2025-03-03",
      content: `
      <h2>Offset Account vs. Redraw Facility: Which Saves You More on Your Home Loan?</h2>
      <p>When choosing a <strong>home loan</strong>, many borrowers come across two popular features: <strong>Offset Accounts</strong> and <strong>Redraw Facilities</strong>. Both can help you <strong>save on interest and pay off your mortgage faster</strong>, but they work differently. Understanding their differences can help you choose the best option based on your financial goals.</p>

      <h3>What Is an Offset Account?</h3>

      <p>An <strong>Offset Account</strong> is a separate <strong>transaction account</strong> linked to your home loan. The balance in this account offsets your loan principal, reducing the amount of interest you pay.</p>

      <h4>✅ Key Benefits of an Offset Account:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduces the <strong>interest charged</strong> on your home loan</li>
        <li>Allows <strong>easy access</strong> to your money via debit card, transfers, and bill payments</li>
        <li>Works like a <strong>regular bank account</strong>, letting you deposit salary and savings</li>
        <li><strong>Tax benefits</strong> for future investment properties</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What Is a Redraw Facility?</h3>

      <p>A <strong>Redraw Facility</strong> lets you <strong>withdraw extra repayments</strong> you’ve made on your home loan. Instead of sitting in a separate account, these additional payments reduce your loan balance, lowering interest costs.</p>

      <h4>✅ Key Benefits of a Redraw Facility:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Helps you <strong>pay off your mortgage sooner</strong> by making extra repayments</li>
        <li>Allows <strong>limited access</strong> to extra funds when needed</li>
        <li>Typically available on <strong>variable-rate home loans</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Offset Account vs. Redraw Facility: Key Differences</h3>

      <table border="1" cellpadding="8">
        <tr>

          <td>Access to Funds</td>
          <td>Instant access via debit card, transfers, bill payments</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Interest Savings</td>
          <td>Reduces loan interest by offsetting the loan balance</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Flexibility</td>
          <td>High — works like a bank account</td>
          <td>Lower — funds may take time to access</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Tax Benefits</td>
          <td>Better for investment properties</td>
          <td>May affect tax deductibility if withdrawn for personal use</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Which One Is Right for You?</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Choose an <strong>Offset Account</strong> if you want <strong>maximum flexibility</strong>, easy access to your money, and potential <strong>tax benefits</strong>.</li>
        <li>Choose a <strong>Redraw Facility</strong> if your priority is <strong>paying off your loan faster</strong> while keeping some access to extra repayments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Final Tip</h3>

      <p>If you're planning to turn your home into an <strong>investment property</strong>, an Offset Account is often the better option to maintain tax deductibility on interest payments. Always consult a <strong>mortgage broker or financial advisor</strong> for personalized advice.</p>

        <h2>Fixed Rate Expiring? Facing High Interest Rates? Here’s What You Can Do!</h2>

        <p>
        If your <strong>fixed-rate home loan</strong> is about to expire, you might be in for a shock—going from 
        <strong>historically low rates (around 2%)</strong> to <strong>standard variable rates exceeding 7%</strong>. 
        But don’t panic! You have options to secure a <strong>better deal</strong> and reduce your mortgage burden. 
        Here are <strong>four solutions</strong> to help you navigate this transition:
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h3>1. Rate Review: Negotiate a Better Deal with Your Bank</h3>

        <p>
        The first step is to request a <strong>Rate Review</strong> from your current lender. 
        You can ask them to match their latest rates or offer a discount based on competitor rates.
        </p>

        <h4>✅ Why it works:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>It’s the <strong>quickest and easiest</strong> option</li>
          <li>No need to switch banks or refinance</li>
          <li>Mortgage brokers often have <strong>stronger bargaining power</strong> to secure additional rate discounts</li>
        </ul>

        <p>💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> While this is a great first step, most banks <strong>won’t offer the lowest possible rate</strong>, so exploring other options is recommended.</p>

        <hr />

        <h3>2. Refinance: Switch to a New Lender for Better Rates & Cash Rebates</h3>

        <p>
        If you have <strong>strong borrowing power</strong>, consider refinancing to another bank. This could help you:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>✔ Get a <strong>lower interest rate</strong></li>
          <li>✔ Receive a <strong>cashback offer (up to AUD 4,288 from some lenders!)</strong></li>
          <li>✔ Reduce monthly repayments by <strong>extending the loan term</strong>, improving cash flow</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Start the refinancing process <strong>before</strong> your fixed term ends to allow enough time for approvals and planning.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h3>3. Streamline Refinance: Lower Borrowing Requirements</h3>

        <p>
        If your <strong>borrowing power is limited</strong>, some major banks offer <strong>Streamline Refinance</strong> options, 
        which have <strong>reduced assessment rates</strong> (e.g., from 3% to 1%). 
        This makes it <strong>easier to qualify</strong> for refinancing even if your income is lower.
        </p>

        <h4>✅ Best for:</h4>
        <p>Borrowers who may struggle to meet standard lending criteria but still want to <strong>switch to a better deal</strong>.</p>

        <p>💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Consult a mortgage broker to check eligibility and find the best Streamline Refinance options.</p>

        <hr />

        <h3>4. Easy Refinance: No Income Proof Required</h3>

        <p>
        Some lenders offer <strong>Easy Refinance</strong>, which allows borrowers to refinance 
        <strong>without providing proof of income</strong>. Instead, they assess:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>✔ Your <strong>past 12 months’ repayment history</strong></li>
          <li>✔ Whether the <strong>new repayment amount is lower</strong> than your current one</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>✅ Best for:</h4>
        <p>Borrowers facing <strong>high interest rates but limited income</strong> who may not qualify for standard refinancing.</p>

        <p>💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> If you’re struggling with loan approval due to income constraints, this could be an excellent alternative.</p>

      title:
        "Final Inspection Before Property Settlement! Did You Get It Right",
      date: "2025-03-13",
      content: `
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        How important is the final inspection before property settlement? If it has been a few months since you first exchanged contracts,
        anything could have happened in the meantime, especially if someone has been living in the property during this period.
        Imagine finding a hole in the wall, stains on the carpet, or leaking pipes—just the thought of it is heartbreaking for any buyer.
        </p>

        <h2>The Final Inspection Is Your Right!</h2>
        <p>
        As a buyer, you have the right to conduct a final inspection of your new property within a week before settlement.
        This ensures that the property’s condition matches what you saw during your initial viewing.
        If there are any discrepancies, you can request the seller to address these issues before settlement.
        </p>

        <p>
        Ideally, you should have conducted a thorough inspection before signing the contract.
        During this initial check, your focus should have been on key areas like the hot water system,
        plumbing, electricity, appliances, air conditioning, locks, bolts, and even curtains and blinds.
        If you found any issues, you could have listed them as special conditions in the contract,
        requiring the seller to fix them before settlement.
        </p>

        <p>
        The final inspection is your last opportunity to ensure that these conditions have been met,
        that any rubbish has been cleared, and that the property has been properly maintained.
        We recommend scheduling the final inspection around five days before settlement.
        This allows enough time to resolve any issues or renegotiate if necessary.
        If possible, try to conduct the inspection after the previous occupants have moved out.
        </p>

        <h2>Who Should Be Present During the Final Inspection?</h2>
        <p>
        Ideally, you should conduct the final inspection with your real estate agent.
        </p>
        <p>
        If the property is being sold privately, you can also conduct the final inspection directly with the seller.
        This is a great opportunity for them to demonstrate how everything in the house works.
        </p>

        <h2>What Should You Check?</h2>

        <h3>1. Any Major Damage</h3>
        <p>
        Walk through the interior and exterior of the property, checking for any damage that may have occurred since the contract was signed.
        For example, if you notice a broken window, you can request that it be repaired before settlement.
        If you're unsure about anything, ask your real estate agent to follow up with the seller.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Included and Excluded Items</h3>
        <p>
        When you exchanged contracts, you and the seller should have agreed on what items would be included and excluded from the sale.
        </p>
        <p>
        For instance, dishwashers, built-in barbecues, and ovens are typically included, as well as curtains and light fixtures.
        The seller can only remove these items if they were specifically listed as exclusions in the contract.
        </p>
        <p>
        Bring a copy of your purchase contract to the final inspection to cross-check included and excluded items.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Cleanliness</h3>
        <p>
        By this stage, your new home should be clean and tidy.
        Any piles of rubbish or garden waste should have been removed unless they were specifically included in the contract.
        If large pieces of furniture have been left behind, ask your real estate agent to confirm with the seller whether they will be removed before settlement.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Special Conditions</h3>
        <p>
        As mentioned earlier, you can negotiate special conditions when signing the contract.
        </p>
        <p>
        For example, if a door lock was loose or broken, you could have added a condition requiring the seller to fix it before settlement.
        </p>
        <p>
        If your contract includes any special conditions, ensure that they have been met before finalizing the settlement.
        </p>

        <h2>What If You're Not Satisfied?</h2>
        <p>
        If you are not satisfied with the final inspection, inform your lawyer or conveyancer immediately.
        They will negotiate with the seller’s lawyer to reach a fair resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
        For example, the seller may be required to fix the issue before settlement, allow another inspection, or agree to reduce the final contract price to cover your repair costs.

    "what-income-proof-does-a-PAYG-director-need": {
      title: "What Income Proof Does a PAYG Director Need?",
      date: "2025-03-17",
      content: `
        <h2>Case Study: Can Self-Employed Individuals Pay Themselves a Salary to Apply for a Loan? What Income Proof Does a PAYG Director Need?</h2>

        <h3>Case Background</h3>
        <p>
        Recently, we assisted a client who is single and has no children. Before the pandemic, he started working as a director at a company and has since received a stable and consistent salary. 
        In January this year, he acquired a 30% stake in the company, officially becoming a shareholder. At the same time, he began purchasing his first home and reached out to us for a pre-approval loan.
        </p>

        <h3>Case Challenge</h3>
        <p>
        Since the client is both a director and a 30% shareholder of the company, his income cannot be simply classified as PAYG (Pay As You Go) income, even though he receives a stable salary. 
        Instead, it must be considered self-employed income.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenge Discussion</h3>
        <p>
        Once classified as self-employed income, the client’s income verification process becomes more complex. He would typically be required to provide additional documentation, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>His most recent individual tax return and ATO assessment notice</li>
          <li>The company’s most recent business tax return</li>
          <li>Profit &amp; loss statement</li>
          <li>Balance sheet</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Since the current financial year has not yet ended, the company’s tax return and financial statements were not yet available. Additionally, financial data from the previous year was negatively impacted by the pandemic, which could lead to the bank underestimating its actual income.
        </p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
        Given this situation, we recommended ANZ Bank’s <strong>Company Wage Policy</strong>. Under this policy:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>If the client has been self-employed for at least 18 months as a company director and shareholder</li>
          <li>And has received a fixed salary from the company for at least 6 months</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Then, his salary can be assessed as PAYG income. He only needs to provide:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>A payslip issued within the last 60 days</li>
          <li>An ATO income statement showing at least 6 months of cumulative income</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Final Outcome</h3>
        <p>
        We submitted the application to ANZ Bank, utilizing their <strong>Company Wage Policy</strong> to classify the client’s fixed salary as PAYG income. 
        This eliminated the need for complex financial documents like business tax returns and profit &amp; loss statements. 
        As a result, the bank recognized his higher salary as an income source, and his loan pre-approval was successfully approved with a higher borrowing capacity.

      title: "How to Get a 90% Loan and Save Nearly $40,000 on LMI",
      date: "2025-03-28",
      content: `
        <h2>Case Background</h2>
        <p>
        Our recent clients, a married couple with no children, were looking to buy their first home. The wife is a registered nurse working at a local medical center.
        Two years ago, they applied for the 887 visa and recently received their visa grant letter.
        </p>

        <p>
        Over the years, they have saved <strong>$220,000</strong> and want to purchase a <strong>high-quality owner-occupied property</strong>. After thorough research, they found a
        <strong>$1.5 million</strong> property that suits their needs.
        </p>

        <h2>Case Challenge</h2>
        <p>
        With only <strong>$220,000</strong> in savings, the couple planned to use <strong>$150,000 as a deposit</strong>, which meant their deposit ratio was <strong>10%</strong>,
        and their Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR) was <strong>90%</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
        At this LVR, banks typically require borrowers to pay <strong>Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI)</strong>, adding a significant cost to their home purchase.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenge Discussion</h2>
        <p>
        In most cases, if a borrower's deposit is <strong>less than 20%</strong> of the property’s value, they must pay LMI. For this <strong>$1.5 million</strong> property, as first-time homebuyers,
        the estimated <strong>LMI cost was around $40,000</strong>, a substantial extra expense.
        </p>

        <p>
        If they had to pay this LMI, their savings wouldn’t be enough to cover both the <strong>deposit</strong> and additional costs like <strong>stamp duty</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>To address this, we introduced the couple to <strong>Westpac’s LMI Waiver Policy</strong>. Under this policy:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Eligible <strong>registered nurses</strong> earning a <strong>gross salary of at least $90,000 per year</strong></li>
          <li>Can secure a loan with only a <strong>10% deposit</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Without having to pay LMI</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Since the wife is a <strong>registered nurse earning over $100,000 per year</strong>, she met the eligibility criteria. This allowed them to
        <strong>avoid paying LMI completely</strong>, saving them nearly <strong>$40,000</strong> in upfront costs.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Outcome</h2>
        <p>
        We successfully submitted their loan application to <strong>Westpac</strong>, utilizing the <strong>LMI Waiver Policy</strong> to eliminate their LMI costs.
        Their <strong>$1.35 million loan was approved</strong>, allowing them to purchase their dream home <strong>without the financial burden of LMI</strong>.

        <h2>Buy a Home with a 90% Loan—No LMI? These Professionals in Australia Are in Luck!</h2>

        <h3>Introducing Healthcare LMI!</h3>
        <p>
        Westpac, one of the world’s leading financial institutions, has launched an exciting new initiative called 
        <strong>Healthcare LMI</strong>, specifically designed for <strong>healthcare professionals</strong>. 
        This innovative program allows eligible professionals to 
        <strong>borrow up to 90% of a property’s value without paying Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI)</strong>—a major financial advantage 
        for homebuyers in the industry.
        </p>

        <h3>What is LMI?</h3>

        Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI) is an additional cost for borrowers who 
        <strong>do not have a 20% deposit</strong> when applying for a home loan. 
        It protects the lender in case the borrower defaults on the loan. While LMI can be added to the loan amount and paid over time, 
        <strong>it’s an extra expense that doesn’t benefit the borrower directly</strong>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Now, imagine buying a home with just a 10% deposit—without paying LMI!</strong> That’s exactly what Westpac’s 
        <strong>Healthcare LMI</strong> offers.</p>

        "Be Aware of Default Payments Amidst Continuous Interest Rate Hike",
      date: "2025-04-07",
      content: `
        <h2>Causes of Default Payments</h2>

        <p>
        For those with home loans, take note! With recent interest rate hikes from banks, monthly repayment pressure has been growing, and many people are experiencing default payments—failure to pay their home loans on time. So, what situations make default payments more likely? What are the causes, consequences, and solutions? Let’s dive into this today!
        </p>

        <p>There are various reasons for default payments. Here are some of the most common:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Fixed Rate Expiry:</strong> Many customers previously had fixed interest rates (fixed rate), where interest was low a few years ago. However, when the fixed-rate period expired, the floating interest rates were much higher, significantly increasing monthly repayments. Many customers forgot to adjust their accounts to reflect the increased repayments, resulting in default payments.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Interest-Only (IO) Loan Expiry:</strong> Some customers previously applied for interest-only loans (IO), and after the term ended, their loan terms switched to principal and interest (P&I). As the repayment amount increased, customers often continued paying the original interest-only amount, which was insufficient, leading to default payments.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Large Increase in Repayment Amounts:</strong> For customers with variable-rate loans, repayments were previously manageable, but due to recent interest rate hikes, many customers either forgot to increase their payments or couldn’t afford to. This led to default payments.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>These are everyday situations where default payments occur. So, what impact can default payments have?</p>


        <h2>Consequences of Default Payments</h2>

        <p>
        As we know, most people have mortgage loans, meaning their property is the collateral. When we default on payments, the bank will first attempt to contact us to collect the overdue loan payments. After all, the bank doesn’t want to auction off our property, as it’s a time-consuming and costly process.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you receive a notice about missed mortgage payments, it’s important to pay the overdue amount within the deadline specified in the notice. Doing so allows your loan contract to continue without issue. However, if you fail to do so, additional fines and interest will accumulate, resulting in financial losses.
        </p>

        <p>
        After persistent attempts to collect, the bank may file a lawsuit in court to seize ownership of the mortgaged property. Once the bank obtains ownership, they can auction the property to recover the loan principal, interest, and associated costs. If the proceeds from the sale don’t cover these costs, the borrower must pay the remaining balance. Additionally, if the property is rented out, the bank may also terminate the rental contract, causing the borrower to lose rental income.
        </p>

        <p>
        Furthermore, the default payment will be recorded on your credit report, negatively impacting your credit score. With current credit reports being very thorough, your history of defaults, how many times it occurred, and the amounts will be fully documented, affecting your future financial activities.
        </p>


        <h2>How to Solve It</h2>

        <p>
        The most straightforward solution is to ensure there are enough funds in your repayment account. During periods of rising interest rates, remember to deposit extra money into your repayment account, as floating rates are generally increasing. If you continue depositing the same amount each month, it may soon be insufficient to cover your increasing repayments.
        </p>

        <p>
        Of course, depositing more money can only solve the problem temporarily. This simple method may work for some, but for most, a more practical solution is to conduct a rate review to lower your repayment amount. This is a more sustainable approach.
        </p>

      title: "How Banks Approve Loans in Australia?",
      date: "2025-06-10",
      content: `
        <div>
          <p>When applying for a loan in Australia, different banks and financial institutions may have slightly varied processes, but they all generally follow a common principle: the <strong>5C Loan Approval Principle</strong>. This principle is used by lenders to evaluate the risk of lending money to a borrower, which helps them decide whether to approve or reject the loan application. Understanding how this principle works can significantly improve your chances of loan approval. In this article, we will break down each of the 5Cs and explain how they affect your loan application.</p>

          <h3>1. Credit</h3>
          <p>
            Credit is one of the most crucial factors in the loan approval process. It reflects your past financial behavior, specifically
            how well you’ve met your financial obligations. Banks assess your creditworthiness using a <strong>credit report</strong>, which details your credit history, including any past loans, credit cards, and repayment behavior.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A high credit score indicates responsible financial behavior, suggesting that you’re a low-risk borrower.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, a history of defaults or missed payments may raise red flags, making banks more cautious in approving your loan.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Even if you’ve had a default, don’t worry — solutions are available, and you can improve your chances of approval by addressing these issues.</p>

          <h3>2. Capacity</h3>
          <p>
            Capacity refers to your ability to repay the loan. Banks look at several factors to determine your
            <strong>borrowing capacity</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Income Source:</strong> Regular income from employment, business, or other sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Income Stability:</strong> Long-term employment or running a stable business strengthens your reliability.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):</strong> This ratio compares total debt to income. A lower DTI indicates manageable debt levels.
              Most banks accept a DTI ratio between 7 to 7.5 times your income.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Banks use this information to assess how much you can afford to borrow and whether you can manage the repayments.</p>

          <h3>3. Capital</h3>
          <p>
            Capital refers to the assets you own, such as property, savings, cars, superannuation, and shares. The more assets you have,
            the more financially secure you appear to lenders.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>More assets suggest good financial habits and a strong financial position.</li>
            <li>Having assets reduces lending risk and increases your likelihood of loan approval.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4. Collateral</h3>
          <p>
            Collateral involves offering valuable assets (such as your home or car) as security for the loan. If you fail to meet repayment obligations,
            the bank can seize the collateral to recover losses.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Collateral lowers lender risk and improves approval chances.</li>
            <li>The more valuable the collateral, the better terms you may receive (e.g., lower interest rates).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Banks typically engage third-party valuers to assess collateral value.</p>

          <h3>5. Conditions</h3>
          <p>
            Conditions refer to the specifics of the loan you’re applying for. Lenders review several factors, such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> Higher interest rates may reduce approval likelihood.</li>
            <li><strong>Loan Term:</strong> Shorter loan terms may be easier to approve.</li>
            <li><strong>Loan Amount:</strong> Smaller loan amounts are typically easier to approve.</li>
            <li><strong>Loan Purpose:</strong> A clear and practical loan purpose helps strengthen your application.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Summary of the 5C Loan Approval Principle</h3>
          <p>When banks assess your loan application, they consider the 5C principle:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Credit:</strong> Your past credit history and credit score.</li>
            <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Your income stability and debt-to-income ratio.</li>
            <li><strong>Capital:</strong> The assets you own.</li>
            <li><strong>Collateral:</strong> Assets you can offer as security.</li>
            <li><strong>Conditions:</strong> Details of your loan request (interest rate, term, purpose).</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            By understanding the 5Cs, you can better prepare for the loan application process and increase your chances of success. Whether you’re looking
            to buy a home, start a business, or consolidate debt, knowing what lenders look for can help you secure the loan you need.

      title: 'FBAA Calls for a Review of the Home Loan "Buffer"',
      date: "2025-07-01",
      content: `
        <div>
          <h2>FBAA Calls for a Review of the Home Loan "Buffer" – What Does It Mean for You?</h2>
          <p>Thinking of buying a home or applying for a mortgage? Then you need to know about the <strong>loan buffer</strong> – a key factor affecting your borrowing power!</p>

          <h3>What Is the Mortgage Buffer?</h3>
          <p>
            In simple terms, a <strong>loan buffer</strong> – officially known as the <strong>serviceability buffer</strong> – is a stress test used by banks and lenders to assess whether
            borrowers can still afford their mortgage if interest rates rise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently set at <strong>3%</strong>, this buffer means that if your loan interest rate is 5%, you must prove you can still repay the loan even if the rate jumps to 8%. This ensures you're financially secure even if rates go up in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            This rule was confirmed on <strong>27 February 2023</strong> when the 
            <strong>Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)</strong> announced that the 3% buffer remains “appropriate.”
          </p>

          <h3>Why Is There a Push to Lower the Buffer?</h3>
          <p>
            With interest rates rising rapidly, many industry experts – including the 
            <strong>Finance Brokers Association of Australia (FBAA)</strong> – are calling for a reassessment of the buffer rate. 
            They argue that the 3% buffer is now too <strong>high</strong>, making it harder for homeowners to 
            <strong>refinance</strong> or qualify for <strong>better mortgage deals</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            FBAA Managing Director <strong>Peter White AM</strong> warned that many borrowers are turning into 
            <strong>"mortgage prisoners"</strong> – stuck with their current lender because they can’t pass the inflated serviceability tests, 
            even if they’ve been paying their mortgage on time.
          </p>

          <p>
            White says, “It’s not the borrowers’ fault that interest rates have surged. But they’re the ones paying the price.
            More consumers and investors are being impacted by these rate hikes every day.”
          </p>

          <p>
            He adds that the <strong>buffer should be reviewed at least every two years</strong>, to ensure it reflects the current economic climate.
            In a recent public poll, <strong>65.7% supported reducing the buffer</strong>, and <strong>70% of brokers</strong> said the current buffer could 
            impact Australia's housing market.
          </p>

          <h3>Expert Views: Is the Buffer Too Strict?</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>PropTrack Senior Economist Paul Ryan</strong> echoed the concerns, saying,
            “Many lenders believe the current buffer is too strict and prevents buyers – especially <strong>first-home buyers</strong> – from entering the market.”
          </p>

          <p>
            While APRA maintains that the buffer is suitable given the <strong>global and domestic economic conditions</strong>, 
            experts stress that future reviews must consider <strong>housing affordability</strong> and <strong>market shifts</strong>.
          </p>

          <h3>Quick Takeaway</h3>
          <p>
            In the past, the 3% buffer made sense due to historically low interest rates. But with current rates already high, many believe a buffer of 
            <strong>1.5% to 2%</strong> would now be more appropriate.
          </p>

          <p>
            The industry is calling for <strong>greater flexibility</strong> and <strong>regular reviews</strong> to support responsible lending without locking out qualified borrowers.

          <p>We don’t have to choose — <strong>we can have both!</strong> Thanks to Australia's government support and smart financial planning, applying for a home loan is possible even while you're on paid parental leave.</p>

          <h3>1. Family vs Career — Do You Have to Choose?</h3>
          <p>Balancing family and a successful career is something many professional women struggle with. Should you work hard now to secure your finances or take time off to have a baby and return to your career later?</p>
          <p>The good news is that <strong>you don’t have to choose one over the other</strong>. The Australian government offers financial support to help new parents, making it easier to manage both family responsibilities and long-term goals like buying a home.</p>

          <h3>2. What is Parental Leave Pay in Australia?</h3>
          <p><strong>Parental Leave Pay (PLP)</strong> is a government-funded benefit designed to support new mothers. You could be eligible for <strong>up to 18 weeks of paid parental leave</strong>, paid at the <strong>national minimum wage</strong>. That means over the leave period, you could still receive around <strong>AUD 10,000</strong>.</p>

          <h3>3. Am I Eligible? Requirements & Documents Needed</h3>
          <p>Applying for Parental Leave Pay is relatively straightforward. Here are the three main eligibility criteria:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Income Test:</strong> Your family’s income in the financial year before the child’s birth must be under <strong>AUD 151,350</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Work Test:</strong> You must have worked for <strong>at least 10 months</strong> in the 13 months before the baby was born, with at least <strong>330 hours</strong> of work in total.</li>
            <li><strong>Residence Test:</strong> You must be a citizen or permanent resident who has lived in Australia for more than 2 years.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Once eligible, you can apply for Parental Leave Pay through <strong>Centrelink</strong>. The good news is that <strong>banks accept this benefit as valid income</strong> when assessing home loan applications.</p>

          <h3>4. Returning to Work? Here’s How It Helps Your Loan Application</h3>
          <p>If you're planning to return to work after your maternity leave and <strong>your salary exceeds the government’s parental leave payments</strong>, lenders can use your future income for loan servicing calculations.</p>

          <p>All you need is an <strong>employment letter</strong> from your employer stating:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your planned return-to-work date</li>
            <li>Your post-maternity salary</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>5. Real Example — Buying a Home While on Maternity Leave</h3>
          <p>Let’s say <strong>Emily</strong> is pregnant and planning to return to work after giving birth. She also wants to <strong>buy a house</strong> during her maternity leave.</p>
          <p>Instead of waiting until she’s back at work, she can apply for a loan now.</p>
          <p>If her job pays well and her income meets lending criteria, her employer just needs to provide a letter confirming her <strong>return-to-work date</strong> and <strong>expected salary</strong>. The bank will use that letter to calculate her borrowing capacity — no delay needed for home ownership dreams!</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Worried you can’t get a home loan while on maternity leave? <strong>Think again.</strong> With the right preparation and documentation, <strong>you can welcome a new baby and buy your dream home at the same time</strong>.</p>
          <p>Thanks to Parental Leave Pay and bank policies that support working mothers, financial freedom and family life can go hand in hand.</p>

            <h2>Did You Know Government Benefits Can Boost Your Home Loan Application? Let’s Find Out How!</h2>

            <p>When we think of government benefits in Australia, we often associate them with basic financial support — but did you know 
            <strong>some Centrelink payments can actually improve your borrowing power</strong> when applying for a mortgage or refinancing?</p>

            <p>In this article, we’ll explain how <strong>Family Tax Benefits (FTB)</strong> and other common welfare payments can support your loan application — with a real-life example to show how it works!</p>

            <h3>1. Centrelink and Your Borrowing Capacity</h3>

            <p>Australia is well-known for its strong welfare system, offering a wide range of support payments. But what many people don’t know is that 
            <strong>certain Centrelink payments can be considered as income</strong> by banks when calculating your home loan eligibility.</p>

            <p>This means you may be able to <strong>borrow more</strong> simply by including eligible government benefits in your application.</p>

            <h3>2. What is FTB (Family Tax Benefit)?</h3>

            <p>Family Tax Benefit (FTB) is a government payment designed to support low and middle-income families with the cost of raising children. It’s commonly known as the <strong>“baby bonus”.</strong></p>

            <p>FTB is divided into two parts: <strong>FTB Part A</strong> and <strong>FTB Part B</strong>.</p>

            <h4>FTB Part A</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Calculated based on your children’s age and household income.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>As of now:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Children under 12: up to <strong>AUD 222.04</strong> per child every <strong>fortnight</strong></li>
                <li>Children aged 13–15: up to <strong>AUD 288.82</strong> per child every <strong>fortnight</strong></li>
                <li><strong>AUD 288.82</strong> for a child <strong>16 to 19 years</strong> who meets study requirements</li>
                <li>To receive the <strong>maximum amount</strong>, your family income must be under <strong>$65,189</strong> per year.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>FTB Part B</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Extra payment for <strong>single-parent families</strong> or <strong>single-income households</strong>.</li>
                <li>If one parent works while the other stays home or works part-time, you may qualify.</li>
                <li><strong>Paid per family</strong> (not per child):</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Families with kids under 5: up to <strong>$188.86</strong> every fortnight</li>
                    <li>Families with kids aged 5–18: up to <strong>$131.74</strong> every fortnight</li>
                    <li>Payment amount reduces based on household income as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Real-Life Example — FTB Helped Unlock Investment Opportunities</h3>

            <p>A recent client came to us hoping to <strong>refinance their mortgage and borrow extra funds</strong> to invest in property. 
            The client’s weekly income was around <strong>$700</strong> (year 2022), which, after running a serviceability calculator, 
            was <strong>not enough</strong> to qualify for the additional funds.</p>

            <p>However, during a deeper discussion, we learned the client was receiving the <strong>maximum FTB payments</strong>.</p>

            <p>What many don’t realise is that these <strong>FTB payments can be fully counted as income</strong> in loan assessments. 
            In this case, the FTB payment <strong>added around 25%</strong> to the client’s total income, significantly boosting their borrowing power.</p>

            <p>As a result, the client was approved to <strong>cash out enough funds</strong> to proceed with their investment property purchase.</p>

            <h3>4. Other Government Payments That Can Support Your Loan Application</h3>

            <p>Besides FTB, many other Centrelink payments can also help increase your borrowing power, depending on the lender:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Age Pension</li>
                <li>Disability Support Pension</li>
                <li><strong>Carer Payment</strong></li>
                <li>Child Care Subsidy</li>
                <li>Widow Allowance</li>
                <li>And many more…</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>✔️ Pro Tip</h3>

            <p>Many government payments <strong>can be used to support a loan application</strong>, but how much each bank accepts varies. 
            Some lenders may only count a percentage of certain benefits, while others may accept the full amount.</p>

            <p><strong>Speak with a mortgage specialist or broker</strong> to understand how much your benefits can boost your loan eligibility — you might be surprised how much you can borrow!</p>

        <div>

          <p>Have you ever applied for a <strong>fixed rate home loan</strong> when interest rates looked favourable, only to find the rate had gone up by the time your loan was settled?</p>

          <p>This happens more often than you think. That’s because there’s often a gap between when you apply for your loan and the actual <strong>settlement date</strong>, and banks use the <strong>rate on the day of settlement</strong> — not the application day — to set your final fixed interest rate.</p>

          <p>That’s where a <strong>Rate Lock</strong> option can really save you.</p>

          <h2>1. What is a Rate Lock?</h2>

          <p>A <strong>Rate Lock</strong> is an optional add-on when applying for a fixed-rate mortgage. It allows you to <strong>secure the interest rate at the time of application</strong>, even if the rate increases before settlement.</p>

          <p>📌 <strong>Example:</strong></p>

          <p>John applies for a fixed rate home loan at 2% with Bank A. By the time settlement comes around, the fixed rate could have increased to <strong>2.3%</strong> or dropped to <strong>1.7%</strong>.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Without a rate lock</strong>, John will have to accept the new rate on settlement day — 2.3% in this case.</li>
            <li><strong>With a rate lock:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>If rates go up, John keeps the original 2%.</li>
                <li>If rates go down, many lenders allow John to take the <strong>lower rate</strong> instead.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>So, a <strong>Rate Lock gives you peace of mind</strong>, especially in a rising rate environment.</p>

          <h2>2. How Long Can You Lock the Rate?</h2>

          <p>Rate lock periods typically range from <strong>30, 45, 60, or even 90 days</strong>, depending on the lender.</p>

          <p>But when does the lock start?</p>

          <p>This varies by bank:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Some start the lock from the <strong>application date</strong></li>
            <li>Others from the <strong>rate lock fee payment date</strong></li>
            <li>Or from the <strong>loan approval date</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>This is why it’s important to check your lender’s specific policy.</p>

          <h2>3. Is There a Cost for Rate Lock?</h2>

          <p>Yes, most lenders charge a <strong>rate lock fee</strong>.</p>

          <p>This may be:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>A <strong>fixed fee</strong>, e.g. $450, or</li>
            <li>A <strong>percentage of your loan amount</strong>, e.g. 0.15%</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Some lenders <strong>offer a rate lock for free</strong>, although this is not usually the main factor when choosing a home loan — but it’s always nice to save where you can!</p>

          <h2>4. Why Choose a Rate Lock?</h2>

          <p>It depends on your personal situation, but a rate lock is <strong>especially valuable for borrowers choosing a long-term fixed rate</strong>.</p>

          <p>For example:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Borrower A</strong> chooses a <strong>1-year fixed rate</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Borrower B</strong> chooses a <strong>5-year fixed rate</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>If rates go up by 0.1%, Borrower A only pays more for <strong>1 year</strong>, but Borrower B will be stuck with the higher cost for <strong>5 years</strong> — that’s a significant difference!</p>

          <p>▲ In a rising interest rate market, a rate lock gives you protection and budget certainty.</p>

          <p>And right now, Australian banks have <strong>started increasing fixed rates</strong> — even though the RBA hasn’t raised the cash rate, banks can independently adjust their fixed rate offers. That’s why <strong>locking in a low fixed rate now</strong> can save you thousands in the long run.</p>

          <h3>✅ Pro Tips</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>If you choose to rate lock, try to <strong>select the longest rate lock period</strong> possible to ensure coverage until settlement.</li>
            <li>If you’re unsure if your lock period is long enough, consult a <strong>professional mortgage broker</strong>. They can help you adjust or extend the lock if needed.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Dreaming of Buying Your First Home in Australia with Just a 5% Deposit?</h2>
        <p>Recently, Australian citizens and <strong>permanent residents (PR)</strong> can access the <strong>First Home Guarantee (FHBG)</strong> scheme. With as little as a <strong>5% deposit</strong>, you could own your first home <strong>without needing to pay thousands in Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI)</strong>.</p>

        <h2>🏡 What Is the First Home Guarantee (FHBG)?</h2>
        <p>The <strong>First Home Guarantee (FHBG)</strong> is part of the Australian Government’s <strong>Home Guarantee Scheme (HGS)</strong>, designed to help eligible <strong>first home buyers</strong> purchase a home sooner.</p>
        <p>Under the FHBG, the government guarantees up to <strong>15% of your home loan</strong>, allowing you to buy a property with as little as a <strong>5% deposit</strong>, while avoiding LMI.</p>

        <h2>💰 How Much Deposit Do You Need?</h2>

        <h2>Find Out If You Qualify for the New Streamlined Refinance Policy</h2>

        <p>💡 <strong>Breaking News for Homeowners and Mortgage Holders!</strong></p>
        <p>Westpac Banking Group, including <strong>Westpac Bank</strong> and <strong>St. George Bank</strong>, has launched a game-changing refinancing policy called <strong>Streamlined Refinance</strong>. This new policy can help you <strong>increase your loan eligibility by up to 20%</strong> — even if your income remains the same!</p>

        <h3>What Is the Streamlined Refinance Policy?</h3>

        <p>Traditionally, banks use a <strong>3% assessment buffer</strong> on top of your current interest rate to evaluate your ability to repay a loan. But with the <strong>Streamlined Refinance</strong>, eligible borrowers can now be assessed using a <strong>reduced 1% buffer</strong>, making it easier to qualify for a higher loan amount.</p>

        <p>🔍 <strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <p>If your actual home loan rate is 5%, under the traditional method with a 3% buffer, you’d be assessed at 8%. Under the new policy, you’d be assessed at just <strong>6%</strong> — <strong>increasing your loan capacity by around 20%!</strong></p>

        <h3>What Is an Assessment Buffer?</h3>

        <p>An <strong>Assessment Buffer</strong> is the extra percentage banks add to your current interest rate when evaluating your repayment capability. It’s a safeguard to ensure you can still repay your loan if interest rates rise in the future.</p>

        <p>The new reduced buffer of <strong>1%</strong> can significantly improve your borrowing power, especially helpful for homeowners looking to refinance in a tough interest rate climate.</p>

        <h3>Who Is Eligible for Streamlined Refinance?</h3>

        <p>Before you jump in, make sure you meet these conditions:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>✅ Your new monthly repayments must be <strong>equal to or lower</strong> than your current repayments.</li>
          <li>✅ You must have a <strong>credit score of at least 650</strong> and no missed or hardship repayments in the last 12 months.</li>
          <li>✅ Your credit report must show <strong>no overdue payments above $0</strong> in the last year (codes “P” and “R” are acceptable).</li>
          <li>✅ Your current mortgage must be <strong>over 12 months old</strong>, with <strong>10–12 on-time repayments</strong>.</li>
          <li>✅ Other loans and credit cards must show <strong>3–12 on-time repayments</strong> in the past year.</li>
          <li>✅ You can <strong>cash out up to AUD 50,000</strong> within the new loan.</li>
          <li>✅ Your new loan must be <strong>P&I (Principal & Interest)</strong>. Interest-only loans are not eligible.</li>
          <li>✅ You must declare <strong>no foreseeable negative changes</strong> in financial circumstances.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Who Is Not Eligible?</h3>

        <p>This offer does <strong>NOT</strong> apply to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>❌ Interest-only (IO) loan holders</li>
          <li>❌ Loans with guarantors</li>
          <li>❌ Debt consolidation loans</li>
          <li>❌ Loan portfolio refinancing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Buying property under a trust structure can offer long-term benefits like asset protection, tax efficiency, and strategic financial planning — but when it comes to getting the loan approved, the process is often far from simple.</p>

        <p>At <strong>Open Mortgage</strong>, we recently helped a client in Sydney settle an investment property purchase through a <strong>family trust</strong> with <strong>three non-family partners</strong>. The situation was challenging from the start — involving multiple borrowers, trust complexities, and a development-approved property.</p>

        <p>Here’s how we navigated the obstacles and delivered a successful outcome, just one week before the settlement deadline.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Client Profile</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Based in Sydney</li>
          <li>Business owner with multiple tobacco retail stores</li>
          <li>Purchasing an investment property under a newly formed <strong>family trust</strong></li>
          <li>Trust included <strong>4 business partners</strong> (non-family members)</li>
          <li>Property had <strong>development approval (DA)</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>🎯 Key Challenges</h2>

        <h3>1. Four Partners, Four Times the Paperwork</h3>
        <p>Each partner in the trust was required to submit full income, asset, liability, and expense documentation. With each person holding other properties and business interests, this significantly increased the workload and complexity of the loan assessment.</p>

        <h3>2. Servicing Requirements for All Trustees</h3>
        <p>Many lenders required all trust members to jointly demonstrate the capacity to service the full loan amount. This meant that if even one member lacked sufficient income or supporting documents, the entire application could be declined.</p>

        <h3>3. Property with Development Approval</h3>
        <p>The chosen property had an existing <strong>DA (Development Approval)</strong>. While the client's intention was to rent out the property, most lenders viewed it as a redevelopment risk and refused to proceed with finance.</p>

        <p>With <strong>settlement just two weeks away</strong>, the clock was ticking. A delay would result in a <strong>loss of 10% deposit</strong> and potentially penalty fees.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>✅ Our Tailored Solution</h2>

        <p>We quickly identified and approached a lender who could meet the specific needs of this case:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Accepted DA-approved properties</strong></li>
          <li>Only required financial documentation from the <strong>trustee company’s sole director</strong> (our client)</li>
          <li>Did <strong>not</strong> require paperwork from the other three partners</li>
          <li>Approved the loan <strong>within one week</strong> of the settlement deadline</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Thanks to our client’s strong income and the trust’s clean structure, the loan was approved and the property settled on time — avoiding legal penalties and preserving the full deposit.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>🎉 The Outcome</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Loan approved with just days to spare</li>
          <li>No delays or settlement issues</li>
          <li>Client avoided breach penalties and preserved their <strong>10% deposit</strong></li>
          <li>A complex trust loan was <strong>finalised</strong> with minimal stress</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>💡 Thinking of Buying Property in a Trust?</h2>

        <p>While trust loans offer many advantages, they’re often misunderstood and mishandled — leading to delays, rejections, or worse.</p>

        <p>At <strong>Open Mortgage</strong>, we specialise in complex loan structures, including <strong>trust loans, company loans, and self-employed applications</strong>. Our expert brokers can help you structure your loan for success — not stress.</p>

        <h2>为什么选择经纪人很重要？</h2>
        <p>优秀的房贷经纪人不只是帮您对比利率。合适的经纪人会理解您的购房目标，用简单清晰的语言解释复杂产品，并在申请到放款的全过程中代表您与各家贷款机构沟通。</p>

        <h3>1. 了解经纪人的经验与资质</h3>
        <p>您可以询问他们从业时间、专业资格，以及受哪家监管机构或行业协会监管。经验丰富、具备正式牌照的经纪人，更能提前识别潜在问题并为您做好准备。</p>

        <h3>2. 关注他们合作的贷款机构范围</h3>
        <p>没有任何一位经纪人可以覆盖所有银行，但他们应当接触到足够广泛的贷款机构，包括主要银行与非银行机构。可以问问他们常用哪些机构、原因是什么，以及这些选择对您的具体情况意味着什么。</p>

        <h3>3. 弄清经纪人的收入来源</h3>
        <p>多数经纪人的佣金由贷款机构支付，而不是直接向客户收费，但了解是否有额外费用依然很重要。透明的经纪人会清楚说明任何前期或持续费用，并以书面形式提供。</p>

        <h3>4. 观察沟通是否清晰顺畅</h3>
        <p>在整个申请过程中，您都应该可以放心提问。选择一位能够及时回复、用通俗方式解释选项，并对时间表、所需文件以及可能结果给出现实预期的经纪人。</p>

        <h3>5. 看重成交后的持续服务</h3>
        <p>优质的经纪服务不会在贷款放款后结束。一位真正站在您立场的经纪人，会定期帮您回顾现有贷款，解释利率变化，并在合适时机讨论再融资等选择。</p>

        <p>通过提前准备这些问题并认真比较不同经纪人，您可以找到一位理解您需求、并在长期房产与财务规划中持续支持您的合作伙伴。</p>

        <h2>房贷利率是如何形成的？</h2>
        <p>房贷利率是您为房屋贷款支付的利息成本。利率高低会直接影响每月还款额，并受到多方面因素影响，包括个人信用评分、贷款金额、贷款年限以及整体市场环境等。</p>
        
        <h3>影响房贷利率的主要因素</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>信用评分：</strong>信用记录越好，通常可以享受越优惠的利率。</li>
          <li><strong>贷款金额：</strong>贷款额度大小可能会对应不同的利率结构。</li>
          <li><strong>贷款期限：</strong>较短的贷款期限往往利率更低，但每月还款压力更大。</li>
          <li><strong>市场环境：</strong>宏观经济与央行政策会影响整体利率水平。</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>固定利率与浮动利率</h3>
        <p>固定利率在约定期限内保持不变，有助于锁定每月还款金额，方便规划预算。浮动利率则会随市场变化调整，起初可能更低，但未来存在一定不确定性。</p>
        
        <p>了解这些关键因素，可以帮助您在选择房贷产品时做出更适合自身情况的决定。</p>

        <p>首次购房是重要的人生里程碑。本指南将从资金准备到贷款审批，帮助您理清每个关键步骤。</p>
        
        <h3>第一步：评估自身财务状况</h3>
        <p>在看房之前，先梳理好自己的财务基础。计算可用储蓄、评估收入稳定性，并了解自己的信用评分。</p>
        
        <h3>第二步：为首付款储蓄</h3>
        <p>大多数贷款机构会要求房价 10–20% 的首付款。建议尽早开始储蓄，并留意适用于首次购房者的政府补贴或优惠政策。</p>
        
        <h3>第三步：获取贷款预审批</h3>
        <p>预审批可以让您更清楚自己的借款能力，也向卖家表明您是有诚意并具备资金实力的买家。</p>
        
        <h3>第四步：挑选合适房产</h3>
        <p>与房产中介合作并参加开放看房活动，综合考虑地段、房屋状况及未来升值潜力。</p>
        
        <h3>第五步：完成贷款与交割</h3>
        <p>选定房产后，与您的贷款经纪人合作完成正式贷款申请与批核流程，最终完成交割并拿到钥匙。</p>

        <p>要顺利通过贷款审批，需要在申请前做好充分准备。以下建议可以帮助您提升通过率。</p>
        
        <h3>提高信用评分</h3>
        <p>良好的信用记录是审批的重要考量。按时还款、减少现有负债，并避免短时间内频繁申请多个信贷产品。</p>
        
        <h3>降低负债收入比</h3>
        <p>贷款机构更偏好负债收入比较低的申请人。可以通过提前偿还部分债务、控制新增负债来优化这一比例。</p>
        
        <h3>准备更充足的首付款</h3>
        <p>更高比例的首付款可以降低贷款机构的风险，有助于提升获批率，并争取更优惠的利率。</p>
        
        <h3>提交完整且真实的资料</h3>
        <p>确保所有收入、资产与负债证明文件真实且齐全，不完整或信息不一致的申请往往会被延迟甚至拒绝。</p>

        <h2>自雇人士贷款：有哪些收入可以被加回（Addbacks）？</h2>

        <p>自己做生意的时候在贷款时有哪些要注意的呢？今天，小编就专门为<strong>自雇人士</strong>带来一个小福利，给大家讲讲<strong>自己开公司有哪些小 tips 可以增加你的贷款能力</strong>。</p>

        <hr />

        <h3>主要的两部分收入</h3>

        <h4>1. 公司利润</h4>
        <p>
        这一部分相信大多数申请者都不会忽略掉。简单来说，很多人自己开公司，每年都会有不错的 company profit，那么公司的利润当然是我们自己的收入的一部分。
        当然如果你自己还在公司内任职，其他每周还有公司发的工资收入的话，工资收入也是可以算进去的。
        </p>

        <h4>2. 公司折旧</h4>
        <p>
        很多银行在提供的 serviceability calculator 里，自雇人士的部分都会有专门的一栏，比如下面。除了利润正常的 profit 之外，非常重要的一项就是 <strong>business addbacks</strong>。
        </p>

        <p>
        有很多自雇人士对这块不是很了解，所以往往也就直接忽略掉了，但是其实很多时候，这个被我们忽略掉的 addbacks，是可以求救命的！那么这个经常被大家忽略的“救命稻草”—— addbacks 到底是什么，要如何使用呢？
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h3>什么是 addbacks？</h3>

        <p>
        自雇主的账作相对比较凌乱，在税务筹划时，大家很多时候不会把车子、设备等进行折旧，从而获得 tax benefit。
        </p>

        <p>
        但是很多人不知道的是，这部分<strong>其实是可以算回到收入里来的一类费用（俗称 addbacks）</strong>。
        因为这部分的花费并不是公司实际支付出的成本，所以银行在审核你的 serviceability 的时候，默认都会把这部分的钱 add back。
        </p>

        <p>
        当然，如果某公司收入实在惨淡，贷款比例又不是很高，也可以把 addbacks 视为鸡肋。但是如果本身就处在贷款 approve 和 decline 边缘的客户，这些意外的 addbacks，有时候真的可以救命。
        </p>

        <p>
        我们遇到很多自雇的客户，在跟我们沟通了解哪些可以被 addbacks 后，顺顺利利地就批了款。
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h3>具体哪些可以 add back？</h3>

        <p>通常像 <strong>depreciation、voluntary super、interest 等等</strong>，这些广为人知的都能被 addback。</p>

        <p>
        当然不同银行也会有不同的 policy，具体的政策还会以实际提交的银行审批为准。关于自雇的一些 addbacks，建议 broker 结合你的实际情况一起帮你规划。
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h3>小贴士</h3>
        <p>
        以上就是常规贷款的全部流程啦，其实整个流程中你需要配合的就是最初的几步，完整无误地提供给我们您的个人信息以及清楚的告知您的诉求。
        之后的具体手续和材料的整理都是我们来进行的，您<strong>只管全程无忧</strong>。
        </p>

        <p>
        当然具体每个 case 都会有一定的要求，有失真的贷款流程建议及时与我们沟通。

        <h2>自雇人士如何增加贷款能力？主要收入与 addbacks 全解析</h2>

        <p>许多自雇伙伴在贷款时都会遇到这样的困惑：第一次做贷款，对整体流程了解不清楚，被 broker 或银行问资料时又担心不安全？今天，小编就带大家全面了解 <strong>贷款的全部流程以及所需材料</strong>，让你更放心！</p>

        <h3>主要的两部分收入</h3>

        <h4>1. 公司利润</h4>
        <p>这是大多数自雇申请人最关心的一部分。简单来说，公司有利润（company profit），银行通常会将其视为贷款人的收入。当然，如果你有公司贷款在身，则每月还贷的支出也会被算入。</p>

        <h4>2. 公司折旧</h4>
        <p>在银行的 serviceability calculator 中，自雇人士除了利润，还会纳入 <strong>business addbacks</strong>。这些项目会直接影响你的可贷额度。</p>

        <hr />

        <h3>什么是 addbacks？</h3>

        <p>简单说，addbacks 是公司里的 <strong>非必要性开支</strong>，例如车子、设备折旧、一次性费用等。这些开支并非实际消耗企业现金流，因此银行在计算还款能力（serviceability）时，会把这些项目「加回」到收入中。</p>

        <p>addbacks 对自雇客户非常重要，因为它们可以显著提高收入，使你更容易通过银行的贷款审批。</p>

        <h3>哪些项目可以 add back？</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Depreciation（折旧）</li>
          <li>Voluntary super（额外养老金）</li>
          <li>Interest（利息支出）</li>
          <li>一次性费用（搬迁费、法律费用等，需符合政策）</li>
        </ul>

        <p>具体适用项目会因银行政策而不同，broker 会根据资料判断哪些 addbacks 可以帮助你提高贷款能力。</p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Base Income & Non-base Income 如何计算？</h2>

        <p>银行会将收入区分为 Base Income 及 Non-base Income。</p>

        <h4>Base Income</h4>
        <p>就是正常的基本工资。</p>

        <h4>Non-base Income</h4>
        <p>则包括：</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bonus（奖金）</li>
          <li>Commission（提成）</li>
          <li>Overtime（加班费）</li>
          <li>Investment Income（投资收入）等</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>银行对 Non-base Income 的要求</h3>
        <p>基本上不同于 Base Income，Non-base Income 会有<strong>不同的计算比例</strong>，例如银行通常会：</p>

        <ul>
          <li>取最近两年的平均奖金</li>
          <li>若奖金不稳定，可能只采用 80%</li>
          <li>若没有持续性，则银行可能不计算此收入</li>
        </ul>

        <p>例如 Bonus，银行可能要求：</p>
        <ul>
          <li>连续两年都有 bonus 才能计算</li>
          <li>奖金金额需可验证（pay slip + 税单）</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h3>举个案例：年收入 $70,000 如何影响贷款能力？</h3>

        <p>假设你年收入为 $70,000，其中：</p>
        <ul>
          <li>$65,000 来自 base income</li>
          <li>$5,000 来自 bonus</li>
        </ul>

        <p>根据不同银行政策，bonus 是否计算 & 计算比例不同：</p>

        <h4>1. 连续两年均有 $5,000 bonus</h4>
        <p>银行可能会采用 80%：</p>
        <p>$5,000 × 80% = $4,000 → 年收入 = $65,000 + $4,000 = $69,000</p>

        <h4>2. Bonus 金额有波动</h4>
        <p>例如今年 $5,000、去年 $3,000，银行可能采用平均值：</p>
        <p>(5,000 + 3,000) ÷ 2 × 80% = $3,200 → 年收入 = $65,000 + $3,200</p>

        <h4>3. 没有连续性 bonus</h4>
        <p>银行可能不承认该部分收入 → 年收入仍为 $65,000</p>

        <hr />

        <h3>小贴士</h3>
        <p>从以上例子可以看出，<strong>同样是 $70,000 年收入，在不同银行计算下可贷额度会差别巨大！</strong></p>

        <p>收入是影响借贷能力的重要因素，建议申请前务必请专业 broker 做准确评估。</p>

        <h2>还款利率直接被银行提高了？！</h2>
        <p>
        “如果你现在贷款正处于固定利率期了结，那么你的是利率将要在今年或明年期满，并且将恢复到标准浮动利率。
        如果你没有能及时再融资（Refinance），那么你有可能直接被银行提高你的基本利率！”
        </p>

        <p>
        举例来说，2021年5月，自住业主的某期固定利率平均1.95%，而今天的标准浮动利率约为6.5%。抵押贷款为100万澳元的借款人每月还款额将从3,700澳元增加到6,000澳元。
        </p>

        <p>
        Bouris表示，银行开始会向借款人发信提醒或告知利率变化和时限。因此在此时此刻，抵押贷款经纪人（Broker）的作用真的很重要！
        </p>

        <h3>这么大的威胁，我该怎么处理？</h3>

        <ol>
        <li>
        <b>提前咨询银行：</b> 在固定利率快要到期时，提前咨询您的银行，了解贷款利率及其他选项。但要注意<b>直接去找银行并不是最优利率</b>，只有新客人才会得到相关较低或更优惠的利率。
        而且不同银行的客服服务和回复时间是不同的，如果您当下的情况很紧急，那么去其他银行可能不是一个最佳的选择。
        </li>

        <li>
        <b>Refinance再融资：</b> 如果您个人担心固定利率两到三年期满后可能面临的
        <b>Standard Variable Rate(标准浮动利率，SVR)</b>威胁，他们可以考虑进行再融资（Refinance）。
        再融资是指借用旧贷款转到另一个银行或贷款机构，并获得更好的利率和还款条件。
        </li>

        <li>
        <b>寻求专业建议：</b> 如果您对房贷和利率方面的知识不够了解，您可以咨询金融顾问或broker的意见，以帮助您做出正确的决定。
        </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>为什么推荐Refinance再融资呢？</h3>

        <ol>
        <li>
        <b>降低还款利率：</b> 前文中提到，银行往往会给客户更优惠的激励利率。通过现有贷款从一家银行转到另一家银行，您就会成为新银行的新增客户，因此可以获得<b>更低的利率</b>。
        通常能支持大部分借款人降低利率的幅度，也能帮助您减轻还款负担。

        <b>获得现金返还（Cashback）：</b> 银行之间为了竞争，会提供丰厚的现金返还奖励。大多数银行会在您贷款完成后，直接给您现金奖励！
        不同的银行给予借款人的金额不同，
        <b>返现金额可高达$4000。</b>
        如果您不知道如何申请返现奖励，您可以联系您的Broker获取支持，专业的Broker会告诉您每家银行的返现细则。
        </li>

        <li>
        <b>获取现金（Cashout）：</b> Cashout是一种把房子或者其他资产的收益套现的方式。
        举个例子来说：开车约5万澳元买到手的产业，5年后，产业市值己上升到9万。
        那么您可以进行cashout，把房产重新估值，您的本身的房贷减少到4w，您就看得见<b>数钱的喜悦</b>！
        您可以用这笔钱做任何事，买房、买车，甚至是拿去投资里更多的贷款！
        </li>

        <h3>先别急，选择好的贷款中介更重要！</h3>

        <p>
        在这篇文章中，Mark Bouris 这位著名企业家也提到了银行和政府需要考虑的问题。
        而贷款中介，作为连接借款人和银行的桥梁，是确保借款人获得最优贷款利率和还款条件的关键。
        因此，选择一个<b>值得信赖的、有经验的贷款中介</b>是至关重要的。
        </p>

        <p>在选择贷款中介时，借款人应该考虑以下几个因素：</p>

        <ol>
        <li><b>经验和声誉：</b> 选择一个有良好声誉和多年经验的贷款中介，可以确保获得最优惠贷款利率和还款条件。</li>
        <li><b>服务质量：</b> 贷款中介的服务质量非常重要，因为他们将帮助借款人申请贷款、准备文档并管理整个贷款过程。</li>
        <li><b>选择多样性：</b> 选择一个提供多种贷款选择的贷款中介，可以让借款人有更多的选择，以便选择最适合他们的贷款。</li>

        <h2>1 Credit Report 信用报告</h2>
        <p>
        信用报告，对于很多人来说可能是熟悉却又陌生的领域，这个词相信大家都听过，但很多人从来没放在心上，觉得自己从来没有参与过贷款等经济行为，
        信用记录肯定是良好的。但其实这是一个误区，并不是只有消费贷款这种大的经济行为才会影响我们的信用评分，很多人会容易忽略的日常regular的经济行为，
        都会影响我们的信用记录，比如账单（gas, electric, water, phone等），如果账单发生逾期，那么，您的信用记录上就会显示一次default。
        </p>

        <p>
        对于澳洲学生群体来说，难免我们偶尔会有所遗漏，导致自己的信用记录里出现违约，所以很多小伙伴常会问concern “如何可以知道我的信用记录好不好？” 
        “我的信用记录如果出现了违约行为，那么我还能可以贷款吗？”今天小编将给大家回答一下这些问题。
        </p>

        <p>
        首先，澳洲的信用记录是可以通过系统进行查询的，如下图。我们的信用评分一般以分数显示，通常来说信用分数达到绿色基本都属于信用良好的客户。
        也就是说，即便大家有不良的信用记录，只要记录不显示红色，还是可以贷款的，相关案例分享会在下面给大家展示。
        </p>

        <h2>2 什么会影响我们的信用分数?</h2>
        <p>
        澳大利亚的银行对于不良信用记录会关注。一种是已付款的违约（paid default），意思是全额支付的违约。另一种是未支付的违约金（unpaid default），
        即您尚未全额支付的违约金。连续的违约在信用评分中是最为加减项的，因此违约信用记录对贷款影响较大。
        个人信用记录中电费账单，如果您逾期付款超过7天，或者您欠款仍无法与缴费机构协调，违约记录将产生。
        一旦出现违约，基本上信用分数就会大幅下降。
        </p>

        <p>
        不过我们也不需要太担心，令人放心的是，即便有不良记录，我们还是可以申请贷款的，因为信用记录并不是贷款审批的唯一一项。
        就您、收入、您拥有多少储蓄、拥有多少其他的贷款等，都会是贷款审批相关的考量部分。
        但如果我们有过违约行为，那么违约金额越少，和越少的违约行为，就更能保证我们贷款的成功率。
        如果大家有过违约的连续金额较小，和违约笔数少的违约，并表示您已经支付了违约金，则一些银行会予以免责处理。
        </p>

        <h2>3 案例分析</h2>

        <p><strong>上图是我们一个真实案例</strong>，从图片上我们可以看到，客户有一笔 utilities bill 发生了违约，非常担心是否会影响到自己的贷款。
        经我们沟通后，客户先将违约金进行了支付，之后信用报告上显示为“paid”。同时，我们也向银行做出了解释，
        这笔违约是一笔“小金额”的违约，只是因为客户的疏忽，固定扣款账户忘记了存钱而造成。
        </p>

        <p>
        最终银行的回复结果是：<strong>“that is fine, would not influence the loan application”</strong>（这没问题，不会影响贷款）。
        </p>

        <p>
        还有一种特殊情况是客户没有意识到的违约，比如搬家没收到账单，或者 credit provider 弄错了。
        这种情况是可以打电话要求让 provider 把 default remove掉的，之后分数就会提高了。
        </p>

        <h3>小贴士</h3>
        <p>
        通过今天的案例分析，我们可以看到，“一些无伤大雅”的违约是不严重要影响到我们的贷款的，但是我们还是要强调提高信用评分的必要性。
        具体建议如下：
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>定期检查您的信用报告，并确保信息准确无误。</li>
          <li>发现错误信息及时向信用报告机构进行更正和删除。</li>
          <li>及时支付账单并支付任何其他应款项。</li>
          <li>设置自动付款，降低信用卡刷爆等。</li>
        </ul>

        <div>
          <p>Double Job Income快来了瞭一下! 如果自己本身不是“qr”,“病”,“残”,“孕”等符合福利金的群体，有没有别的方式来增加我们的借贷能力呢?</p>

          <p>当然有啦~恰巧最近我们有一个客户，本身无任何福利金可领取，但是通过我们的协助，成功申请到了想要的贷款，买到了心仪的投资房。今天小编以这个case为例，跟大家讲一讲如何合理的运用自己的常规开支来增加我们的借贷能力double job income 多份工作收入。</p>

          <h3>工作收入分类</h3>
          <p>首先我们要了解的是，银行在审核评估贷款人的时候，最重要的部分就是我们自身的收入了。General的来说，银行对于上述统一类的申请人，若是提供得清晰且资料较齐全，一般都会较容易贷得到。</p>

          <p>具体细分的话，在澳洲大部分的工作性质又会被分为全职工作(Full-time)，兼职工作 (Part-time)，临时工 (Casual) 以及合同工 (contractor)。</p>

          <h3>全职工作Full-time & 兼职工作Part-time</h3>
          <p>对于这一类情人来说，由于是属于正常收入，收入有保障，所以银行需要的证明材料比较简单。一般提供得清晰的payslip即可，部分银行可能也会要求提供3个月的工资进账流水。</p>

          <p>另外，只要是permanent 工作无论是全职或是兼职一般银行都没有入职时长要求，而且很多银行可以接受probation 试用期的工资。</p>

          <h3>临时工作Casual & 合同工Contractor</h3>
          <p>临时工与合同工有时在生活状态工作段长，也没有带薪病假和年假。这种情况下，银行的审核会更加严格。一般需要为同一个雇主连续工作至少6个月，或者在同行业至少工作6个月以上。</p>

          <p>所需文件为最新的payslip需要显示6个月以上的Year to date （YTD）累计工资。如果没有6个月的YTD，也可以提供最新的Pay slip 加上去年的income statement。因为casual每个月收入不稳定，所以银行一般会用6个月的平均工资 annualize 年薪。</p>

          <h3>真实案例分析——一份全职+一份兼职=Dream House</h3>
          <p>近期一位客户找到我们，在初期的洽谈中我们了解到，客户有一份稳定的全职工作，希望买一套投资房。</p>

          <p>但问题在于客户的工资并不高，只有6万出头，属于比较低的收入。但是在后来的沟通我们知道到客户自身有部分副业水平ν，虽然已经是全职工作，但不是permanet level，因此工作收入并不足以申请贷款。根据客户提供的资料我们为他做了serviceability calculator，发现如果只有目前的“稳定收入”还无法支持贷款购买投资房的条件。</p>

          <p>在与客户进一步沟通后，了解到了他们的工作很久不同，但好在比较轻松。同时由于所在行业的特殊优势，客户自身有足够的时间与精力去从事临时的工作。客户也很愿意多做一份工作来为自己打算投资房。他希望自己能够通过做第二份工作，提高自己的工资流水，改善自己的财务白收入状况，为提升自己的收入和借贷能力，为自己的财务自由之路迈出了坚实的一步。</p>

          <h3>小贴士</h3>
          <p>通过多方面工作带来的加自己的收入已经成功如分析的前梦梦计算中。在澳洲有3份工的伙伴们也比比皆是。无论你是全职或是兼职是临时工或着合同工，记得准备好相关文件与资料就好。</p>

        <p>首付不够？如何贷款100% 还不用付LMI - Family Guarantee Mortgage 了解下</p>

        <p>房价在整体走上涨，对于当代年轻人来说，能够攒够首付已经变成了一件非常不容易的事情。面对生活需求以及心仪的物业，很多年轻人梦寐以求能有一个小秘诀，算你们幸运，我们最近了解到一个优秀的产品。很多时候，我们想买房除了存硬筹首付之外，也可以尝试与自己的家人尤其是自己的父母来帮忙。今天我们来讲讲一下Family Guarantee Mortgage – 家庭担保贷款方案。</p>

        <h3>什么是Family Guarantee Mortgage</h3>

        <p>Family Guarantee Mortgage是指你的家庭成员可以使用他们的资产价值作为你的首付款的抵押来为我们提供担保。家庭成员指的是直系亲属，包括你的父母/子女兄弟姐妹。值得注意的是，担保人需要与借款人有良好的关系，并且我们在选择申请人的父母来做家庭担保保人时，对于其他的直系亲属，需要参考不同银行的具体要求。申请人可以从担保家庭成员的资产中提取一部分，来作为首付款进行购买。</p>

        <h3>家庭担保的优点</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>最大化我们的贷款能力，相比常见的80%贷款比率，使用家庭担保我们最多可以达到100%的全部贷款，还外加印花税等额外费用；</li>
          <li>减少LVR（Loanto value ratio 贷款比率），使得申请人在一定程度上可以不用支付LMI（Lender’s Mortgage Insurance抵押保险），可以为申请人节省很多额外的费用；</li>
          <li>收入材料简单，仅需申请人收入满足贷款需求即可，无需担保人出收入证明；</li>
          <li>降低风险系数，在还款期间，只有我们在申请人满足了银行要求的还款比例，可以随时申请解除家庭担保所用的抵押物；</li>
          <li>家庭担保贷款也可以帮助借款人打破收入不足，从而不会使大家错过自己心仪的房产啦;</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>举个例子</h3>

        <p>举例来说，如果小明想要买一套房子，但是自己的存款不足20%的首付，这时候他需要向担保人申请以他们的房子子。或者向银行提高加贷款比率，但是会产生相应的LMI保险费用和更高的利率。而我们家庭担保可以帮助小明节省LMI的费用，相信小明也愿意不开心。但是如果小明的父母可以拿出自己的资产担保，比如部分的房产来抵押，那么小明不仅可以免除绝大部分的额外费用，甚至可以不用额外的首付款，拿到100%的贷款额，这下开心啦~</p>

        <h3>家庭担保的风险</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>当贷款申请人无法正常还款时，担保人需要帮忙还款，如果担保人也没有足够的钱来支付的话，担保人的房产或许会被出售用来补偿款；</li>
          <li>如果使用定期存款作为担保，只承担取不出7天内的资金会受到一定限制，具体要参照不同银行的要求；</li>
        </ol>

        <p>会一定程度上影响担保人的借贷能力</p>

        <h3>小贴士</h3>

        <p>综上所述，有条件的小伙伴们请不要再自己辛辛苦苦地去凑首付啦，毕竟好房不等人~快问问自己父母是否能帮自己一把，希望大家都能尽早住进属于自己的dream house!</p>

      title: "澳洲房贷该选固定还是该选浮动？",
      date: "2025-09-19",
      content: `
        <p>在澳洲贷款大致分为三种，客户在买房申请贷款的时候，可以选择Fixed rate和Variable rate，以及Split loans，即Fixed rate和Variable rate的组合。客户可以根据自己的需求来选择利率的类型。</p>

        <h3>Variable Rate - 浮动利率</h3>
        <p>首先介绍一下<strong>浮动利率（variable rate）</strong>的特点，顾名思义，<strong>利率会跟着市场变动而变化</strong>。每个月的第一个周三，澳洲联储RBA都会宣布现金利率决议，每个银行会进行相应调整。浮动利率的最大优势在于其灵活性。浮动利率的房屋贷款中有些产品可以与抵消账户（offset account）结合使用，让客户可以将多余的资金存入抵消账户中，以减少房贷账户的利息。</p>

        <p>举个例子，贷款账户本金有50万美元，另一个抵消账户有5万。如果您开一个对冲账户，然后在对冲账户里存入5万，那么您只需要按45万的余额支付利息了。对冲账户能帮助您低成本优化利用工资收入及其他资金来抵减房贷的利息。此外若浮动利率房屋贷款不限制对冲账户。</p>

        <p>浮动利率房屋贷款的劣势在于<strong>利息也会随着市场的不断波动而变化</strong>。也就是说客户在享受利率下调的惠利同时，也承担着上涨的风险。</p>

        <h3>Fixed Rate - 固定利率</h3>
        <p><strong>固定利率（fixed rate）</strong>指的是在一定期限（即固定期限，一般为1-5年）内，房屋贷款的<strong>利率保持不变</strong>。这意味着在固定期限内，房屋贷款利率不会随市场波动而改变，无论RBA宣布加息或降息都不会对其产生影响。因此固定利率自动变成市场中的低浮动利率。</p>

        <p>稳定性是固定利率的最大优势。在固定期间内，房屋贷款的利率不变，客户可以清楚地掌控未来几年的资金运作，也无需担心银行加息对自己房屋贷款成本带来影响。</p>

        <p>然而固定利率的缺点就是<strong>缺乏灵活性</strong>：如果在固定期间您需要做任何变更，比如更改产品、转贷、提前还清贷款、增加贷款额度或者变更房产等，均有可能需要<strong>支付高额的解约金（break cost）</strong>。固定利率贷款也无法关闭或减少对冲账户的使用。</p>

        <h3>Splits Loan - 浮动和固定组合</h3>
        <p>客户可以选择<strong>浮动和固定结合</strong>，将贷款分为两部分或以上的Splits。这样的组合的优势在于，利率上涨时，固定利率部分可减少利息的增加，而当利率下调时，浮动利率部分能让您享受更低利息。</p>

        <p>此外，<strong>浮动利率部分拥有较大的灵活性，可随时还款</strong>，也可将多余资金存放到对冲账户中以减少利息。一些银行还对这种组合型房屋贷款提供额外优惠。</p>

        <p>就目前的市场环境来看，许多银行都给出较低的利率折扣，尤其是浮动利率随着RBA连续加息，受到较大影响，因此选择组合型贷款能让客户多一份保障。</p>

        <p>如果大家对利率的选择有什么疑问，或者不确定自己该选择哪种贷款产品，欢迎随时联系专业的贷款Broker。</p>

      title: "如何最大化贷款能力？Common Debt Reducer 你了解吗?",
      date: "2025-10-13",
      content: `
        <p>假设你和他人（如伴侣、朋友、家人亲戚、同事等）有一笔写在两人名下的房屋贷款，现在你想要以个人名义单独申请一笔新的房屋贷款。那银行会如何对你个人的债务做出怎样的评估呢？这就涉及到“共同债务减少者”(Common Debt Reducer, CDR) 的概念。今天小编就带大家了解一下什么是‘CDR’，以及如何使用此政策改善第二套房贷款。</p>

        <h3>1. 什么是 CDR</h3>
        <p>通常来说，如果第一套是双方联名的房产，双方应当各自承担总债务的50%，也各自有相应收入的50%。但是如果日后其中一方之后要买第二套房并且自己申请银行做贷款审核，很多银行不会在做债务的100%纳入收入上来了。</p>

        <p>不过也有一些银行做评估时，只将一套房屋贷款的50%纳入收入上各方，这就是我们所说的<strong>共同债务减少者</strong>(Common Debt Reducer, CDR) 政策。</p>

        <p>简单来说，“共同债务减少者”指的是当你在贷款的时候，如果其他的债务提供者能够提供收入证明，例如工资、奖金证明，证明其具有偿还债务的能力，那么银行就只考虑你所承担的一部分债务（通常为50%）。租金收入也会被考虑进收入范畴。</p>

        <h3>2. 举个例子</h3>
        <p>Harry 和他的哥哥Homer有一个写在两人名下的共同房屋贷款。最近Harry遇到了Sally，两人很快结了婚，并想拥有共同的梦想之家。</p>

        <p>首先，Harry 和Sally来到银行。银行对Harry说：“我们可以把你和哥哥联合房产的租金收入的二分之一纳入你的收入评估中，但是，你必须有能力同时承担所有的债务，以及你和哥哥联合房产的100%的债务。”</p>

        <p>这样一来，债务太高，两人根本买不起新房。</p>

        <p>因此，Harry 和Sally来到Broker。银行对Harry说：“我们有共同债务减少者政策。在这种政策下，除了承担新的房贷之外，你只需承担你和哥哥联名房产<strong>50%的债务</strong>。”</p>

        <p>这样一来，由于负债下降，Harry 和Sally终于有能力购买属于他们的<strong>新房子</strong>。</p>

        <h3>3. 小贴士</h3>
        <p>除此以外，还有一些提高个人贷款能力的方法，例如：减少信用卡的数量；降低信用卡额度；减少生活费中不必要的支出；尽量按时偿还个人贷款，提高个人信用评分。</p>

        <h3>4. 谁可以申请</h3>
        <p>“共同债务减少者”政策的前提是已经有联合贷款。想以个人名义购买第二套房产的投资者。前提是，可以向银行提供“共同债务减少者”的收入证明或还款证明，如租金收入证明。成功获得CDR政策后，债务会根据个人情况重新分配。</p>

      content: `
        <h2>什么是预付利息？</h2>
        <p>提前支付全个月利息的固定利率投资贷款的一种选择。它可以让您先支付下一年的利息，并允许您将其作为今年的税收减免项目。一般来说，预付利息比每月或是息息风及时小，因为银行会提供相对比较低的预付贷款类型利率。</p>

        <h3>举例</h3>
        <p>黄先生年收入 10 万，根据澳洲税法，2017/2018 财年他需要缴纳所得税 $26,117。房屋贷款金额：50 万<br>
        贷款类型：预付年利率 3.98%<br>
        利息金额：19,900 元。每年 900 美元（代表这个月的利息）为黄先生于 2018 年 6 月 30 日提前预付投资贷款 19,900 年利息。</p>

        <p>Wong 先生将在 12 个月内就可以，能够在 2017/2018 收入年度减免 7,466 美元。</p>

        <h3>要点</h3>
        <p>通过选择已为预付利息，黄先生能够最大限度地提前该财政年度的节省所得税。然而，预付利息仅对某些投资者有利，例如：投资贷款 — 具有这些贷款类型的房地产投资者均为自住屋的投资者。例如：一个做投资者（投资者香港地区于本财政年度的收入高于下一个财政年度，因此他可以从负扣税中受益）。最后但非最不重要的一点是，预付利息可以帮助那些投资者避免因通涨利率而产生的罚金。</p>
